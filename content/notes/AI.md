#### Self Supervised Learning
* [[W2V-BERT |Notes on W2V-BERT]] 
	* w2v-BERT is a framework that combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to discretise input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualised speech representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretised tokens.
