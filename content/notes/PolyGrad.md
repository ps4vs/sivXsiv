## PolyGrad

The paper ["World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533) introduces novel world modelling approach "Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion" (PolyGrad) that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model.

> Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows, as they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from policy.
